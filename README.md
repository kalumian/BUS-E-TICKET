# Bus E-Ticket Platform

## 1. Problem Description and Project Objective
The intercity public transport sector faces major operational challenges due to the lack of digital infrastructure among many companies. This results in inefficient booking management, difficulty in reaching customers, and complicated payment processes. Additionally, the absence of integration among service providers makes the booking experience cumbersome and ineffective for customers. Moreover, small and emerging companies struggle with digital transformation due to high costs and a lack of technical expertise. These gaps lead to reduced operational efficiency and hinder growth and expansion opportunities in the sector.

## üöÄ Project Setup and Execution

### üîß Backend Setup
1. The backend is connected to a **PostgreSQL database** by default.
2. To change the database connection:
   - Navigate to the **configuration file** in the **Core Layer**.
   - Replace the existing **database URL** with your own.
   - Run the following command to apply the database structure:

   ```sh
   dotnet ef database update
If you are using the default database connection, you can log in with the following admin credentials:

Username: Admin0
Password: Kalumian@4002
üé® Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend project directory.

Install dependencies by running:
```sh
npm install
```
Start the frontend server with:

```sh
npm start
```
The application should now be accessible via the local development server.
